**DISCLAIMER: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Current Participants

## Contributors

- Anyone who wants to contribute
- The whole [BigchainDB Team in Berlin](https://github.com/orgs/bigchaindb/people)

## Maintainers

Everyone with the ability to merge pull requests. Today that is mainly BigchainDB employees.

In the future, we can add more people who are not BigchainDB employees as maintainers.

Some people have specializations:

- Python Driver: Katha
- JavaScript Driver: Manolo
- Core: Vanshdeep, Alberto
- Docker, Kubernetes, NGINX: Shahbaz, Muawia
- Docs: Troy

## Administrators (Founders and Others)

- Kamal - @GataKamsky
- Gautaum - @gautamdhameja
- Alberto - @vrde
- Vanshdeep - @kansi
- Troy - @ttmc
- Trent - @trentmc (Inactive but advising)

Note: Administrators serve limited terms of six months or less. That's the idea, anyway.

# BigchainDB Enhancement Proposals (BEPs)

This is the BigchainDB Enhancement Proposal project. We collect BEPs for APIs, protocols, and processes.

The process to add or change a BEP is the following:
- A BEP is created and modified by pull requests according to [C4](./1).
- BEP lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in [COSS](./2).
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on [Raw](./2#raw-beps) and [Draft](./2#draft-beps) specifications.
