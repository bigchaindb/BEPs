# BigchainDB Enhancement Proposals (BEPs)

This is the BigchainDB Enhancement Proposal project. We collect BEPs for APIs, protocols, and processes.

The process to add or change a BEP is the following:
- A BEP is created and modified by pull requests according to [C4](./1).
- BEP lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in [COSS](./2).
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on [Raw](./2#raw-beps) and [Draft](./2#draft-beps) specifications.
