# BigchainDB Enhancement Proposals (BEPs)

This is the BigchainDB Enhancement Proposal project. We collect BEPs for APIs, protocols, and processes.

The process to add or change a BEP is the following:

- A BEP is created and modified by pull requests according to [BEP-1 (our variant of C4)](./1).
- The BEP life-cycle SHOULD follow the life-cycle defined in [BEP-2 (our variant of COSS)](./2).
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on [Raw](./2#raw-beps) and [Draft](./2#draft-beps) specifications.

## Current Participants

### Contributors

- Anyone who wants to contribute
- The whole [BigchainDB Team in Berlin](https://github.com/orgs/bigchaindb/people)

### Maintainers

Everyone with the ability to merge pull requests. Today that is mainly BigchainDB employees.

In the future, we can add more people who are not BigchainDB employees as maintainers.

Some people have specializations:

- Python Driver: Katha
- JavaScript Driver: Manolo
- Core: Vanshdeep, Alberto
- Docker, Kubernetes, NGINX: Shahbaz, Muawia
- Docs: Troy

### Administrators (Founders and Others)

- Kamal - @GataKamsky
- Gautam - @gautamdhameja
- Alberto - @vrde
- Vanshdeep - @kansi
- Troy - @ttmc
- Trent - @trentmc (Inactive but advising)

Note: Administrators serve limited terms of six months or less. That's the idea, anyway.
