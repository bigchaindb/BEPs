# BigchainDB Enhancement Proposals (BEPs)

This is the BigchainDB Enhancement Proposal project. We collect specifications for APIs, protocols, and processes.

The process to add or change an EIP is the following:
- A specification is created and modified by pull requests according to [C4](./1).
- Specification lifecycle SHOULD follow the lifecycle defined in [COSS](./2).
- Non-cosmetic changes are allowed only on [Raw](./2#raw-specifications) and [Draft](./2#draft-specifications) specifications.
