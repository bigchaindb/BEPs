## Abstract
The "Shared Workspace Protocol" provides a simple set of rules for people working in the same workspace.

## Motivation
Focusing in a shared workspace (or in the office in general) can be a really challenging task. Working from home solves the problem, but it is not an ideal solution if forced by the difficulty to focus in the office.

## Language
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) \[[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)\] \[[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)\] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Rationale
SWP provides a reusable collaboration model for people working in the same workspace. It has these specific goals:

1. To maximize focus and productivity, by reducing the sources of distraction.
1. To reduce the burden to ask people to "behave" or "leave the room", by having an explicit protocol people agree before entering the room.

## Implementation
1. When implemented, this protocol MUST be visible at the entrance of the shared workspace.
1. A person SHOULD write a message to another person before speaking with them.
1. A person SHOULD NOT be loud.
1. A person SHOULD NOT talk to more than one person at a time.
1. One-on-one conversations MUST be short and occasional.
1. A person MUST NOT have calls unless everyone in the room is involved.
