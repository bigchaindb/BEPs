## Description

Currently, there is no active strategy to address breaking changes in BigchainDB 2.0 i.e. there is no general approach to migration such that breaking changes in transaction specs can be handled. This document is an attempt in quantifying scenarios wherein a breaking might occur and propose a generalized strategy to handle these situations.


## Hard fork scenarios
1. Change in any of the transaction specs
    - Change in signature algorithm
    - Change in hashing functions
    - Change in schema
2. Change in storage schema
3. Tendermint introduces a hard fork because of breaking changes


## Handling Hard Forks

### Type 1 scenarios
In case of change to spec it might not be possible to port all existing validated transaction to the new format. In such cases one needs to make a distinction between transactions which have already been validated and stored in the Blockchain from new incoming transactions. Furthermore, a suitable trigger is needed so that the network can collectively jump to the new logic else there could be situations wherein the network might not be able to commit any new blocks because of honest nodes running different validation logic. So, it is apparent that a mechanism for transitioning to this new validation logic is needed. Below is one such procedure to achieve the same,

- In order to decide when the validation logic should be upgraded to its newer version a TEP is initiated which defines the future block `height` at which to upgrade and the corresponding `BigchainDB` class to use.

   NOTE: It is assumed that the new validation logic is implemented by extending the existing `BigchainDB` class and at the time of starting BigchainDB an instance of each of these classes is passed to the ABCI `App` i.e.,
   ```python
   validation = {
       "v1": {
           "start_block_height": 0,
           "validation_class": "BigchainDB",
       }
       "v2": {
           "start_block_height": 20940394,
           "validation_class": "BigchainDBv2",
       }
       ...
   }
   ```

- Each node operator needs to approve the [TEP](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/pull/44) proposal in order for the validation logic to be upgraded.

- If a super-majority of the network i.e. `> 2/3` voting power agrees with the change and the proposed height is still lies in the future then the proposed TEP is commit-ed and a new validation version is added (see above)

NOTE: There can only be one-and-only one ongoing hard fork i.e. concurrent hard forks should not be not allowed.


### Type 2 scenarios

These scenarios don't actually impact the sanctity of the blockchain but rather the shape of the data. In order to handle such scenarios following two approaches can used,

#### Approach 1

Create migration scripts for each new upgrade i.e. with each new release which results in a change in the shape of the data we create corresponding migrations scripts. Needless to say that writing such scripts might be tedious and in the worst case users can only incrementally upgrade to newer version

#### Approach 2

Tendermint allows to create follower nodes which don't validate transactions but rather just receive them and record them. We use this migrate data in the following manner,

- The node operator create an new node which follows its existing validator node. 
- This will allow this new follower node to replay all the blocks but store them according to the new data shape. 
- Once this new follower node fully syncs with the current validator node the node operator shuts down Tendermint and changes the `prox_app` address in `config.toml` to the follower nodes BigchainDB server.
- The operator can then go ahead and discard the existing older BigchainDB server and the corresponding data.

The above process ensure the node keeps validating and accepting new blocks while the new database is being populated. The downtime experienced is when the Tendermint is shutdown to change the `proxy_app` address.


### Type 3 scenarios

This section advises on how to approach backwards-incompatible upgrades of the Tendermint chain - the type of updgrades when Tendermint can not build blocks on top of the existing chain.

BigchainDB operators need a convenient way to do the following:

1. Stop building blocks when the old Tendermint chain is at a jointly chosen height.
2. Continue building blocks using the new Tendermint chain starting from that height.
3. Replay the whole blockchain after a migration.
4. Join the network as a new validator after a migration.

Additionally, BigchainDB HTTP API usage has to be seamless - all the HTTP responses has to look like there were no migrations.

Below we describe how to perform a migration while meeting the postulated requirements. Note that there is no limitation on the number of consequent migrations that can be performed this way.

#### 1. Stop building blocks

A CLI command can be used to instruct the node to stop building blocks at a chosen height.

To make sure no blocks are committed after the agreed height, we propose an election process:

- The initiator creates an election.
- The validators vote for the election. Once the election is concluded, new blocks are not committed by the validators. New transactions from the users are rejected. New blocks sent by Tendermint are rejected too. Further in this BEP we refer to the height at which the election is concluded as the migration height. The conditions for resuming the chain operation are described below.

To perform a migration election, we propose 2 CLI commands.

The initiator executes:

```
$ bigchaindb migration new --private-key /home/user/.tendermint/config/priv_validator.json
```

The command outputs the migration ID. The initiator distributes it among other members of the network. The process is similar to adding new validators.

Validators vote for the migration:

```
$ bigchaindb migration approve <migration-id> --private-key /home/user/.tendermint/config/priv_validator.json
```

Validators can watch how the election goes:

```
$ bigchaindb migration status <migration-id>
```

Outputs:
```
votes_recieved=<Sum_of_votes_recieved>
votes_allocated=<Sum_of_votes_allocated_in_election>
network_size=<Total_network_power>
election_status=<Election_status>
```

#### 2. Replay the blockchain

In order to replay the chain up to the migration height, we need to either keep the old Tendermint version running or skip replaying the corresponding part of the chain = archive the chain. We consider the former to be a huge hassle so we describe an archiving scheme further in this BEP.

#### 3. Start the new chain

Validators have to install and launch the new version of Tendermint. They need to prepare a new `genesis.json`. The new genesis file has to contain the validator set, the application hash (both at the migration height), and the identifier of the new Tendermint chain (`chain_id`).

The application hash is calculated by computing the Merkle tree root of the current UTXO. Note that hash calculation is a subject to design in a separate BEP and can be changed in the future.

`chain_id` is generated and stored by BigchainDB upon conclusion of the migration election. When Tendermint sends this ID as part of the `InitChain` ABCI request, BigchainDB understands that the user has switched to a new Tendermint version so BigchainDB switches to accept new transactions and blocks.

To offer a convenient way to get the data, we propose a CLI command:

```
$ bigchaindb status
```

Its output can be extended over time to solve different purposes. For a start, it has to contain the latest known list of validators, the latest known app hash, and the identifier of the Tendermint chain.
```
{
    "chain_id": "...",
    "validators": [{
        "pub_key": {
            "type": "...",
            "value": "..."
        },
        "power": "...",
        "name": "..."
    },
    "app_hash": "..."
}
```

Validators upgrading Tendermint are supposed to execute the command above and copy the validators, the app hash, and the chain ID into their `genesis.json`.

Validators joining the network after the migration take the genesis file from existing validators, as usual.

#### 4. Join the network after a migration

When a validator joins the network after a migration, it does not suffice for him to know `genesis.json` - he also needs the archive of the old chain.
There might be more than one migration, so the initial chain might go from height 0 to 33277, the second chain might go to height 88234, the third chain can go from 88234 up to the recent height. In this case the validator has to get an archive containing archived blocks from height 0 to height 88234.

Such a validator needs to take a snapshot of the old chain from an existing member of the network. The snapshot can be created via a CLI command:

```
$ bigchaindb migration create-snapshot
```

The command creates the `bigchaindb.snapshot` file that needs to be transferred to the new member. The snapshot contains all BigchainDB collections to restore the old chain from.

The new validator needs to start BigchainDB without Tendermint and apply the snapshot:

```
$ bigchaindb apply-snapshot <snapshot>
```

After the snapshot is applied, Tendermint can be started.

Note that although the new node can join the network and work to some extent without applying the snapshot, it is not able to properly validate transactions so applying the snapshot is a must.

Also note that new validators joining a permissioned network inherently have to trust at least a single validator - there is no generic way to assess the validity of `genesis.json` and the archive snapshot upon joining the network.

#### Tendermint chain height

Upon concluding a migration, BigchainDB is advised to store the current migration height in a separate MongoDB collection. Every time BigchainDB needs to communicate the height to Tendermint, it needs to subtract the migration height from the height of the BigchainDB chain.

With every consequent migration, the migration height is overwritten.

The migration height needs to be a part of the BigchainDB snapshot.

#### Seamless HTTP API usage

Since BigchainDB retains the blocks built by old Tendermint chains, the HTTP API offers the exact same experience as if there were no migrations.
